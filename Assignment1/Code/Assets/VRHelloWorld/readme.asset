  title: WVRV402 Hello VR World Demo Readme
  sections:
  - heading: Intro
    text: This is a minimal example project to allow you to create VR projects for
      the WRVR402 module. It allows a VR avatar to be moved using a desktop/laptop
      to control movement via the keyboard, and a mobile device and Google Cardboard
      to control head movement and allow for depth vision. The devices are connected
      to one another over a local network (WiFi works best).

  - heading: Implementation (Networking)
    text: This project makes use of the open source package called Mirror for establishing
      and managing the network connection between the two devices. It is responsible
      for establishing a connection, creating the correct types of objects (based
      on whether the desktop or mobile device), synchronising the position and orientation
      of certain objects and finally closing a connection.

    text: Multiple instances of the project can be run in editors using the ParrelSync
      editor extension.

  - heading: Implementation (VR)
    text: The project makes use of the open source Google Cardboard SDK, a low cost
      solution for Virtual Reality apps. It is responsible to head tracking and rendering
      to the mobile device, allowing stereovision.

  - heading: Usage
    text: '1) Build the app on Android, deploy to a mobile device and insert it into
      the Google Cardboard holder. 2) Run the desktop app and click on START HOST.
      3) Run the mobile app, click on FIND SERVERS, then click on the IP Address
      of the Host that should appear. Note that the host and the client devices must
      be on the same local network. Put mobile device into the Google Cardboard.
      4) Control the position and orientation of avatar on the desktop using WASD
      or arrow keys. 5) Control the camera orientation by looking around. '

  - heading: Troubleshooting
    text: If your mobile device is not able to connect to the host running on the
      desktop/laptop, do the following. go to Windows Firewall settings -> Advanced
      Settings ->Inbound Rules. Find Unity Editor in the list. If it has a red cross
      in front, right click the entry, and select Properties. Then under General
      tab, select "Allow the connection" under Actions
